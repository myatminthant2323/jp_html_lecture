		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive and actor. He is one of the most successful musical artists of the 21st century.[2] In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eminem has been scrutinized, as a rapper and personally.[49] He was married twice to Kimberly Anne "Kim" Scott. He met Kim in high school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J's "I'm Bad".[251] Kim and her twin sister Dawn had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15, and he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim in 1989. Their daughter Hailie was born on December 25, 1995. The two were married in 1999 and divorced in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, "I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again", he and Kim briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April,[252] agreeing to joint custody of Hailie.[253] He also has custody of Dawn's daughter Alaina[254] and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship.[255][256] In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Kim had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship.[257] He had legal custody of his younger half-brother Nathan.[258][259] In his 2014 song "Headlights", Eminem apologized to, and reiterated his love for his mother.[260]
